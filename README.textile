AdiDebug is a debugging helper addon.

It allows addon to easily (and optionnaly) send debug output into a dedicated frame.

h2. How to use AdiDebug in your addon

Ensure AdiDebug is loaded (if present) before your addon by adding it in the "OptionalDeps" header of your addon .TOC file.

pre. # OptionalDeps: AdiDebug

Then add this stub at the top of your addon:

pre. local Debug
If AdiDebug then
	local addonName = ...
	Debug = AdiDebug:GetSink("MyAddonName")
else
	Debug = function() end
end

If AdiDebug isn't loaded, you just have an empty Debug function that discards anything passed to it.

h2. How to use it in game

Type "/ad" or "/adidebug" to toggle the frame.

You can select the stream to watch by using the dropdown menu in the top left corner. You can also pass the name to the chat command, e.g. "/ad myaddon".

You can move or resizing the frame by shift-clicking almost anywhere in it ; use the borders to resize and the interior to move. Size and position are saved across sessions.
